        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <h3>One Church, Six Locations</h3>
        <p>The Austin Stone is a New Testament church with six congregations that exists for the supremacy of the name and purpose of Jesus. We believe Christ’s life, death, and resurrection are essential to God’s plan to heal and redeem our fallen world, and we're dedicated to being a part of what He’s doing in our city and throughout the nations.</p>

                <h4>How It Started</h4>
                <p>The Austin Stone began in Matt and Jen Carter's small south Austin apartment in 2002. At the first meeting, 10 people squeezed into the Carters' living room and spent time praying for the future of The Austin Stone—longing to be a church rooted in the gospel, one that married the richness of theological truth with deep compassion for the city.</p>

            <div class="story-item">
                <h4>How We've Grown</h4>
                <p>The Austin Stone quickly grew out of that small apartment to a middle school cafeteria on South Congress, and again to Austin High School in just a few years. Today, we’re still at Austin High, but we also meet at five other locations across the city.</p>

                <h4>Where We're Going</h4>
                <p>Over the years, we've sent hundreds to proclaim the gospel throughout the nations, trained thousands to live out their faith in their workplace and at home, equipped parents to care for and lead their children, supported church planters, and partnered with nonprofits.</p>

        <h2>Our Name</h2>
        <p>If you spend enough time in Austin, you're bound to see historic courthouses, churches, and homes built of impossibly white, expertly carved Texas limestone. Around here, that rock is known by another name—Austin stone. All those buildings are an unmistakable part of the landscape, and if you dig deep enough, the stones that form their foundations can be found underneath the city itself. Quite literally, our city is built on Austin stone.</p>
        <p>There's a beautiful parallel between that reality and the picture Peter paints in Scripture of believers being like stones laid on top of one another to build a living temple. Peter details how Jesus is the Cornerstone of His people—the place where God's presence dwells.</p>
